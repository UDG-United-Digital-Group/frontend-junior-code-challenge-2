# Code Challange 2 - Meme Generator

Create and share fun memes! Create a meme generator to add well-known meme templates with your own text or create your own individual memes!

## 1. Objective

The goal is to implement an application to create memes. The task is divided into the following sub-tasks / functions.

1. Upload image files as a base
2. Add / edit a text in the upper area of the screen
3. Add / edit a text in the lower area of the screen
4. Possibility to download the meme (JPG / PNG / GIF)
5. Styling of the texts
   - Font size
   - Font color (color picker)
   - Font (Arial, Comic Sans, Pacifico)

## 2. Design

The presentation should be **structured** and **appealing** for users. Colors and fonts can be chosen freely. The front end should consist of only one page.

## 3. Implementation

You have a free hand in the choice of technologies. Whether JavaScript, PHP, C#, Java etc. is entirely up to you. Use what you master best.

The following is important to us:

- Why did you choose this technology / language
- How confident are you in dealing with the selected language / technology
- Why did you choose a particular framework

We want to know what level of knowledge you have.

### 3.1 Use of 3rd party libraries

The implementation can be done with the help of **3rd party libraries**. All libraries used (which are not part or dependency of a frontend or backend framework) must be **referenced**. Please also explain why you chose exactly these libraries.

### 3.2 Maintainability

Well-structured and documented code is important for implementation. Compliance with current **Best Practices** and **Coding Style Guidelines** (depending on the language / technology used) is desired.

Your code should be **readable** and **understandable** - even for third parties. The program flow should also be traceable.

Keep in mind that you and / or others need to build on this code and expand the project.

## 4. Supply

When you are finished with the task - or have only completed part of the time, you can provide us with your work result as follows:

1. Provide us with the link to your code repository
   - If you don't have one yet, you can get one of the leading providers (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [AzureDevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), ...) create an account and make your project available there.
   - Please make sure that the visibility of the repository is set to "Public"

2. Add a copy of the attached file [Task Result](Task&#32;Result.md) and fill in all points accordingly.

3. If you want to provide a demo of your project, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers an easy way.
